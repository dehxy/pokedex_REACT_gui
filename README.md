My React Pokedex
This is my first project using React to build a Pokedex. It uses a JSON file for the data and displays all the Pokémon on a single page.

What it does
Reads Pokémon data from a local pokedex.json file.

Displays a card for each Pokémon, showing its picture, name, number, types, and weaknesses.

Uses simple CSS for the styling to make it look clean.
